                    I am a CLP Facilitator for our department's Introduction to C++ course. Every week I will create a C++ practice worksheet in LaTeX based on recent course material for the course. Once a night every week students can attend my CLP session and work through the practice sheet.

                <p>
                    This was my summer research experience I did over the summer of 2023. It was an amazing experience and introduced me to the topic of NLP which has become one of my favorite topics in all of computer science. During this program, I gained invaluable experience in NLP, research question formulation, literature surveying, and academic paper writing. The program helped to assure me that I wanted grad school to be my next step and that I wanted to pursue further education specifically in the topics of AI, ML, NLP, and/or cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research was on automated authorship obfuscation and the viability of utilizing a psycholinguistic theory known as Uniform Information Density. I created three different algorithms that automated the obfuscation process of a large quantity of text. After obtaining the results (with some help from a graduate student at PSU), I analyzed & discussed the success of the algorithms. While my results were not anything groundbreaking due to some technical issues, the experience of conducting in-depth research on an advanced topic like NLP was immensely educational.

                            During my Introduction to Algorithms course (FA 2023) I and another student developed an automated maze generator and solver. The mazes were generated utilizing Iterative Dept-First Search while the mazes were solved utilizing A*. Taking the project beyond the scope of the course requirements, we compared the actual space and time complexity of the algorithms with the algorithm's theoretical space and time complexities. We are hoping to port the code to C++ and redo our test as we believe the Python libraries used to measure space complexity did not properly measure the memory usage properly.

                            This was my final game project for my Game Dev 1 Course (FA 2022). I worked on this game with two others and served as the group leader. It is one of my favorite projects I have ever worked on and, I believe it is one of the most quality projects I have ever produced. The game was made in rough 4 weeks and required lots of team collaboration to get it done. It features a randomly generated map, enemy AI, and a complex combination of sounds, animations, and scripts.

                            For my Fall 2023 Database class project, I opted to create a web scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup for the F1 2023 season. The goal was to extract, transform, and load practice, qualifier, race, team, and driver data into an SQL database. While many manually copied data, I took on the challenge of automating the process. It took me three days to develop the scraper, and with weekly updates in mind, I successfully automated the ETL process. The script can fetch and update data in my SQL server within 5-10 minutes, providing valuable hands-on experience in web scraping.

            <p>
                Around 2021 I got into baking as a hobby. I find it relaxing and enjoyable to create a complex baked good from a variety of basic items.

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
                I got really into reading at the start of COVID in 2020. It was something that was hard to get into due to the demanding nature of high school sports. However, COVID gave me ample time to start reading for fun.

            <h4>Favorite Reads</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Alan Turing: The Enigma</i> - I read this because I wanted to learn more about Alan Turing as a person. I knew the impact of his work on the world of computers, but I found his personal journey and story to be fascinating. This book was a wonderful read for both the historical/academic perspective it provides to computing as well as the personal lessons it endows on the reader.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Song of Ice and Fire Series</i> - Being a massive fan of Lord of the Rings, I was eager to jump into this series. While I just recently finished the third book and I am patiently waiting to pick up the fourth, I can tell the series will be one of my favorite reads of all time. The complexity of each character, the intense stakes of every major event, and the flawed/relatable characters is why I love this series.

                <li>
                    <i>Brave New World</i> - Possibly my favorite book of all time, it was a required reading for my AP Literature class in high school. Typically, I struggled to get into the readings required for classes in high school, but this book was different. I was enthralled and ended up reading the whole book in a day! While technology might not be the same as ours, the lessons one can glean from the tragic state of their society can most certainly be applied to our society. A beautifully tragic story that I need to read again soon.
