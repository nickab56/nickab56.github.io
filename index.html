                        I'm a senior computer science major at Saint Vincent College, expected to graduate in spring 2024. I'm passionate about all
                         things related to computers, with a particular love for Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                         and Machine Learning (ML), and I enjoy applying cybersecurity concepts to these areas. I also have a minor in philosophy.

                        My current aim is to pursue further education in graduate school, focusing on AI, NLP, ML, and/or cybersecurity. 
                        empower the next generation of students and equip them with the skills to achieve their life goals in the world of technology.

                    I am a CLP Facilitator for our department's Introduction to C++ course. Every week I will create a C++ practice worksheet in LaTeX based on recent course material for the course. Once a night every week students can attend my CLP session and work through the practice sheet. Students are encouraged to ask me questions regarding the topics covered in the course or that are in the worksheet.

                <h4>Research Experience for Undergrad</h4>
                <p>
                    This was my summer research experience I did over the summer of 2023. It was an amazing experience and introduced me to the topic of NLP which has become one of my favorite topics in all of computer science. During this program, I gained invaluable experience in NLP, research question formulation, literature surveying, and academic paper writing. The program helped to assure me that I wanted grad school to be my next step and that I wanted to pursue further education specifically in the topics of AI, ML, NLP, and/or cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research was on the topic of automated authorship obfuscation and the viability of utilizing a psycholinguistic theory known as Uniform Information Density. I created three different algorithms that automated the obfuscation process of a large quantity of text. After obtaining the results (with some help from a graduate student at PSU), I analyzed & discussed the success of the algorithms. While my results were not anything groundbreaking due to some technical issues, the experience of conducting in-depth research on an advanced topic like NLP was immensely educational.

                <p>
                    I started working in the IT Department at SVC in 2020 as a freshman. Though it was mainly as a helpdesk technician and designated printer fixer. However, due to my interest in cybersecurity and work ethic, I was able to get 'promoted' to be a Sys. Admin and Cybersecurity Assistant.

                <p>
                    Utilizing different tools like Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, and data sanitization software, I assisted our school's Cybersecurity Technician with his typical daily work. This job provided me with more real-world experience in how the theoretical cybersecurity concepts I learned about are actualized in maintained in a complex and dynamic environment.

            <h3>Baking</h3>
            <p>
                Around 2021 I got into baking as a hobby. I find it realxing and enjoyable to create a complex baked good from a variety of basic items.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One of my favorite items to bake has been cinnamon rolls from scratch. They take almost a whole day to prepare properly and then require chilling in a freezer overnight. While th eprocess is long, the reward of making homemade cinnamon rolls is worth it.

                </li>
                <li>
                    I also recently tried my hand at making a homemade pizza dough from scratch. This was a challenge because I've never made something like pizza and it requires a very different process compared to my normal baking items.

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>
                I got really into reading at the start of COVID in 2020. It was something that was hard to get into due to the demanding nature of high school sports. However, COVID gave me ample time to start reading for fun.
            </p>
            <h4>Favorite Reads</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Alan Turing: The Enigma</i> - I read this because I wanted to learn more about the Alan Turing as a person. I knew the impact of his work on the world of computers but I found his personal journey and story to be fascinating. This book was a wonderful read for both historical/academic perspective it provides to computing as well as the personal lessons it endows on the reader.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Song of Ice and Fire Series</i> - Being a massive fan of Lord of the Rings, I was eager to jump into this series. While I just recently finished the third book and I am patinetly waiting to pick-up the fourth, I can tell the series will be one of my favorite reads of all time. The complexity of each character, the intense stakes of every major event, and the flawed/relatable characters is why I love this series.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Brave New Wolrd</i> - Possibly my favorite book of all time, it was a required reading for my AP Literature class in high school. Typically, I struggled to get into the readings required for classes in high school but this book was different. I was entrhalled and ended up reading the whole book in a day! While the technology might not be the same as ours, the lessons one can gleam from the tragic state of their soceity can most certainly be applied to our soceity. A beautifully tragic story that I need to read again soon.
